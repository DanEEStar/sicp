# Chapter 1

## 1.1.3
In special form the arguments don't get evaluated.

## 1.1.5
Applicative order versus normal order

## 1.2.1
Recursive processes and iterative processes.
* Any iterative process can be realized "in hardware"
* An iterative process can be programmed tail-recursive
* [Can every recursive process be transformed into an iterative process?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7106656/can-every-recursive-process-be-transformed-into-an-iterative-process)
* [Design patterns for converting recursive algorithms to iterative ones](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1549943/design-patterns-for-converting-recursive-algorithms-to-iterative-ones)

## 1.2.4 (ex 1.16)
The technique of defining an invariant quantity that remains unchanged from state to state is a powerful way to think about the design of iterative algorithms.

## 1.3.2
* A let expression is simply syntactic sugar for the underlying lambda application.

## 1.3.4
Rights and privileges of first-class elements:
* They may be named by variables
* They may be passed as arguments to procedures
* They may be returned as the results of procedures
* They may be included in data structures
